Documentation for the Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

Project Description

This project is a simple browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The game determines a winner when one player forms a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner. It includes a reset button to restart the game.

Main Features

1. Game Board:
   - Displayed as a 3x3 grid.
   - Cells are dynamically created using JavaScript.

2. Player Turns:
   - Players take turns placing "X" and "O".
   - The game starts with player `X`.

3. Winner Determination:
   - After each turn, the game checks for a winner or a draw.
   - If no winner is found, the game continues.

4. Game Reset:
   - A "Reset" button allows players to restart the game.

Technologies Used

1. HTML:
   - Structure of the game board.
   - UI elements like the reset button and status display.

2. CSS:
   - Styling for the game board, cells, and buttons.
   - Hover effects for interactivity.

3. JavaScript:
   - Core game logic:
     - Handling cell clicks.
     - Determining the winner or draw.
   - Dynamic creation of the game board.
   - Game state management.

Code Structure

1. HTML:
   - Key Elements:
     - `<div id="game-board">`: The game grid.
     - `<p id="status">`: Displays the current game status.
     - `<button id="reset">`: A button to reset the game.

2. CSS:
   - Grid styling for a 3x3 layout.
   - Cell hover effects for better UX.
   - Styling for buttons and text.

3. JavaScript:
   - Key Functions:
     - `createBoard()`: Initializes the game board.
     - `handleCellClick(event)`: Handles player turns when a cell is clicked.
     - `checkWinner()`: Checks if the current player has won.
     - `resetGame()`: Resets the game state and clears the board.
   - Logic:
     - Alternates turns between players.
     - Updates the game status dynamically.
     - Identifies and announces a winner or draw.

How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
2. The interface includes:
   - A 3x3 game grid.
   - A status display showing the current player or game result.
   - A "Reset" button to restart the game.
3. To play:
   - Click on any cell to place your symbol (`X` or `O`).
   - Alternate turns until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.
4. After the game ends, click "Reset" to start a new game.

Example Usage

1. Open the file in a browser.
2. Player `X` clicks on a cell—`X` is placed, and the status updates to "Player O's turn".
3. Player `O` clicks on another cell—`O` is placed, and the status updates to "Player X's turn".
4. If a player completes a winning line, the status updates, e.g., "Player X wins!".
5. For a new game, click the "Reset" button.

Winning Logic

The program checks the following winning combinations (cell indices):
[0, 1, 2]   Top row
[3, 4, 5]   Middle row
[6, 7, 8]   Bottom row
[0, 3, 6]   Left column
[1, 4, 7]   Middle column
[2, 5, 8]   Right column
[0, 4, 8]   Main diagonal
[2, 4, 6]   Secondary diagonal

Future Enhancements

1. Highlight Winning Combination:
   - Add visual effects for the winning line.
   
2. Score Tracker:
   - Maintain a tally of wins for `X` and `O`.

3. AI Player:
   - Implement an AI opponent using algorithms like Minimax.

4. Animations:
   - Add animations for placing symbols or resetting the board.

Conclusion

This project showcases the fundamentals of working with DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation in JavaScript. It is a scalable project that can be extended to include advanced features like animations or AI.
